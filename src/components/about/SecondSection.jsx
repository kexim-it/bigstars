          Powering Agriculture Sustainably, One Tonne at a Time

          The company operates a 12-metric-tonne-per-hour feed mill equipped with advanced, energy-efficient machinery designed to minimize waste and conserve resources. They prioritize using locally grown, non-GMO soybeans and other ingredients to support Ghanaâ€™s agricultural sector and reduce transportation emissions. By processing soybeans in-house, they reduce external supply chains, allowing them to maintain strict quality standards while minimizing their carbon footprint.
